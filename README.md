# ZeroDay-Project

The main goal of this project is to help a new employee start their job smoothly on their 
first day. When a company uses this project, the new employee will receive all the 
necessary documents and watch important videos before they begin their work. This 
process saves time and makes the onboarding more efficient for both the employee 
and the company.

The project is built using Python Flask, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap, and Blueprint. Python 
Flask is used to create the web interface and handle the application's logic, while 
PostgreSQL is used for managing and storing data. Bootstrap is used to design a 
responsive and user-friendly interface, and Blueprint helps in organizing the code into 
manageable modules. These technologies work together to ensure the project is 
effective and provides a great user experience.
